# Roadmap

Two goals, one codebase: a demo that shows the engineering, and the option of a personal execution system.
**The demo comes first**, so the phases are ordered by what a reader can see, and each step is chosen so that
it also keeps the later path open instead of paying for it now.

The seam that makes both possible already exists: `Strategy`, `IMatchingEngine` and `IOrderBook` are the only
things the pipeline knows about, and `src/market/` holds one reader per input format. A live feed is another
reader, and paper trading is the existing book and matching engine against that feed.

## Where the project stands

| | |
|---|---|
| Delivered | the queue model, the fee model, the two latency legs, the order trace and the queue distribution, four sweeps of the strategy levers, and a four-tier gate |
| The binding result | at a one-tick spread the fee is 2.57 ticks against 0.088 captured, and no lever moves that ratio |
| Frozen | the pre-queue-model line is tagged `v1.0-demo` |
| Open | the conclusions rest on one day, and nothing has been run against a live feed |

## The phases

| Phase | Work | What it buys | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — packaging** | one branch, the `v1.0-demo` tag, the documents in the published navigation, a code CI | a reader sees a maintained repository with a history rather than two unfinished ones | done |
| **1 — evidence** | the headline conclusions re-run on a second day, which the repository already holds, and the queue-model bounds experiment recorded | closes the two questions the documents could not answer: does it generalize, and how much does the queue model matter. Both are now recorded, and the second day's numbers are behind a marked block in the gate | done |
| **2 — the live paper milestone** | a websocket book feed, a paper-trading mode reusing the book and the matching engine, and a recorder that writes the live feed in the replay format | the strongest statement available here: one strategy drives a replay and a live session, and a live session becomes replayable | one to two weeks |
| **3 — system only** | persistence and recovery, limits that refuse orders, a real venue adapter at small size, multi-instrument accounting | none of it is checkable by a reader, so it waits until the demo is finished | later |

## Deliberately not planned

* **Order-by-order (L3) data.** The bounds experiment shows the conclusions do not move between the
  conservative and the optimistic queue models, so a true queue in between cannot move them either. Finer
  data would buy precision on secondary numbers, at the price of a different instrument and the measured
  history that goes with it. If it is ever worth doing, it is one day of data used to calibrate the existing
  model offline, not a new runtime path.
* **More strategies and more knobs.** The binding constraint is the fee, so a better quote rule changes how
  much is lost rather than whether anything is.
* **Cosmetic repository work.** No demo recordings, no badges. The documents are the interface.

## How the two goals stay compatible

| Choice made now | What it keeps open later |
|---|---|
| every input format behind one reader in `src/market/` | a live feed is another reader, not a second pipeline |
| the strategy talking to interfaces only | the same code can be driven by a replay or by a live book |
| execution reports as the only input to accounting | a real venue's fills update the portfolio unchanged |
| determinism and replay as pinned properties | a recorded live session can be replayed and compared |
